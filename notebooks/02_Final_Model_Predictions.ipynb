    "In this notebook, we load the final trained model and apply it to the competition dataset in order to generate the final predictions required for submission.\n",

    "1. Load the trained model saved as _mejor_modelo.pkl_\n",
    "2. Load and preprocess the competition dataset (_attrition_competition_xx.csv_)\n",
    "3. Use the trained model to generate predictions\n",

    "These predictions will be used as the final submission for the practical assignment on employee attrition prediction."

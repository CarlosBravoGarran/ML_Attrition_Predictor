    "During the process of imputing missing values, the use of **KNNImputer** was tested as an alternative to **SimpleImputer**. However, the results obtained with **KNNImputer** were inferior in terms of model performance. This could be due to the fact that, with very few missing values in the dataset, the use of KNNImputer introduces unnecessary noise by attempting to estimate values based on the nearest neighbors.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Impact of Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)__\n",
    "- **Optimized Decision Tree** improves over the base model in **all metrics**, achieving a **Balanced Accuracy of 0.8578** (+4.6%) and a **TPR of 0.7595** (+6.9%), indicating better detection of the minority class without losing precision in the majority class.\n",
    "- **Optimized KNN** improves significantly, with a **Balanced Accuracy of 0.8469** (+8.2%) and a **TPR of 0.7278** (-10.8%), showing that optimization has made KNN more effective at balancing predictions, though with a slight reduction in minority class detection.\n",

    "3. Training time for optimized models increases, but it remains manageable for Decision Tree, while for KNN it is considerably higher.\n",
    "4. HPO optimization is effective and justified, as it improves overall accuracy and balance without an excessive computational cost for Decision Tree.\n"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Selection of preprocessing methods: Different strategies for data imputation, variable scaling, and data encoding have been explored.\n",
    "- Model comparison: Recommendations have been received on how to structure the evaluation of base models versus optimized models through hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- Code improvement: It has helped improve and refactor some code blocks to enhance their efficiency and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, the original idea proved to be better than the AI's recommendation. For example, AI suggested specific hyperparameter ranges for optimization, but the original idea of using a broader range allowed for better exploration and improved model performance. Similarly, while AI recommended a particular imputation strategy, the original approach resulted in more consistent results across different models.\n",

    "- Meaning and interpretation of metrics like balanced accuracy, TPR, and TNR.\n",
    "- Differences between internal evaluation (inner evaluation) and external evaluation (outer evaluation).\n",
    "- Hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and its application in model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __3. Support in Documentation Writing__\n",
    "For the preparation of the report, AI has served as an assistant in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organizing sections and document structure.\n",
    "- Writing clearer and more concise explanations.\n",
    "- Formulating conclusions based on the obtained results.\n",
    "- Style correction and clarity in the exposition of ideas.\n",
    "- Writing the section 'Use of AI in the Development of the Work'\n",
